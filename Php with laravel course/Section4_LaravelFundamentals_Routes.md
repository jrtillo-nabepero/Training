# Section 4: Laravel Fundamentals - Routes

### Routes

- Routes allow the convenient generation of URLs or redirects for specific routes. You may specify a name for a route by chaining the name method onto the route definition:!!Route names should always be unique.
- Named routes facilitate easy URL generation and redirection, and you can name a route by appending the name method to its definition. Each route name must be distinct.
- Routes can utilize HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, OPTIONS, and ANY.
- A Laravel application's root directory includes several subdirectories and files, including app, config, database, public, resources, routes, storage, and vendor.
- The app directory houses the main application code, such as controllers, models, middleware, and other classes.
- The routes directory defines the application's routes.
- Laravel offers a full-fledged testing suite, comprising unit tests, feature tests, and browser tests, making it simple to verify the application's proper functionality.
