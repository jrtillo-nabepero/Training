**Tinker**

- Laravel Tinker is an interactive REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) for the Laravel framework, utilizing the PsySH package.
- Tinker enables command-line interaction with your entire Laravel application, including Eloquent models, jobs, events, and other components.
- To start the Tinker environment, execute the tinker command using Artisan.

Simple Exercise :
