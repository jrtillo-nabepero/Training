## Introduction to Laravel

- Laravel is a php framework that uses MVC architecture model.
- It comes with a built-in templating engine called Blade, allowing developers to create dynamic layouts and templates efficiently.
- It provides an elegant syntax which aims to ease the common tasks like routing, authentication, sessions, and caching.
- Laravel's robust migration system helps manage database schema changes using PHP code instead of raw SQL, making database management more intuitive and version-controlled.
- Laravel supports modern PHP features and practices, such as dependency injection, unit testing, and an expressive routing system, making it a robust choice for building modern web applications.
