# Section 4: Installing Docker

### Steps in installing docker:

- Install Docker: You can download the appropriate Docker package for your operating system from the official Docker website. Docker provides packages for Windows, macOS, and various Linux distributions. Follow the instructions to install Docker on your system.

- Verify the installation: Once the installation is complete, you can verify it by running the following command in a terminal window:

```
docker --version
```

- This should display the version of Docker that you just installed.

- Configure Docker (optional): Depending on your use case, you may need to configure Docker. For example, you may need to configure Docker to use a proxy server or to enable remote access to Docker. You can find detailed instructions on the Docker documentation website.

- That's it! Once you've completed these steps, you should be ready to use Docker on your system.
